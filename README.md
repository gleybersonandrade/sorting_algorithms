# Sorting Algorithms

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.

This project is a group of several sorting algorithms implementations.

## Running

* Execute a sorting algorithm:

```
python main.py -a {algoritm} -n {number} -o {order} -s {size}


    * algorithm: execute sorting algorithm (insertionsort, heapsort, mergesort, quicksort, radixsort, selectionsort, shellsort)

    * number: number of input values

    * order: order of input values (crescent, decreasing, random)

    * size: size of input values (small, large)
```
